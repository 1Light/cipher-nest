# Cipher Nest

## Overview
Cipher Nest is a web-based encryption and decryption tool that utilizes AES, 3DES, and OTP encryption algorithms. It supports multiple encryption modes, including ECB, CBC, CFB, and CTR for AES and 3DES. The application is built using Django for the backend and a modern frontend stack including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Dart Sass, Autoprefixer, and PostCSS. It also features AJAX for real-time rendering without page reloads.

## Features
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Supports AES, 3DES, and OTP encryption methods.
- **Multiple Modes**: AES and 3DES support ECB, CBC, CFB, and CTR modes.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Uses AJAX for encryption and decryption without reloading the page.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Bootstrap for responsiveness and ease of use.
- **Modern Frontend Stack**: Uses Dart Sass, Autoprefixer, and PostCSS for efficient styling.
- **Secure Implementation**: Ensures data security through cryptographic best practices.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- Django (Python)
- Django REST Framework
- Cryptographic libraries for encryption/decryption

### Frontend
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Bootstrap for UI design
- AJAX for real-time processing
- Dart Sass for advanced styling
- Autoprefixer & PostCSS for CSS optimization
